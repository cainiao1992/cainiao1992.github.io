# Trivy configuration
#
# Trivy DB contains vulnerability information from NVD, Red Hat, and many other upstream vulnerability databases.
# It is downloaded by Trivy from the GitHub release page https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-db/releases and cached
# in the local file system. In addition, the database contains the update timestamp so Trivy can detect whether it
# should download a newer version from the Internet or use the cached one. Currently, the database is updated every
# 12 hours and published as a new release to GitHub.
trivy:
  # ignoreUnfixed The flag to display only fixed vulnerabilities
  ignore_unfixed: false
  # skipUpdate The flag to enable or disable Trivy DB downloads from GitHub
  #
  # You might want to enable this flag in test or CI/CD environments to avoid GitHub rate limiting issues.
  # If the flag is enabled you have to download the `trivy-offline.tar.gz` archive manually, extract `trivy.db` and
  # `metadata.json` files and mount them in the `/home/scanner/.cache/trivy/db` path.
  skip_update: false
  #
  # The offline_scan option prevents Trivy from sending API requests to identify dependencies.
  # Scanning JAR files and pom.xml may require Internet access for better detection, but this option tries to avoid it.
  # For example, the offline mode will not try to resolve transitive dependencies in pom.xml when the dependency doesn't
  # exist in the local repositories. It means a number of detected vulnerabilities might be fewer in offline mode.
  # It would work if all the dependencies are in local.
  # This option doesn't affect DB download. You need to specify &quot;skip-update&quot; as well as &quot;offline-scan&quot; in an air-gapped environment.
  offline_scan: false
  #
  # Comma-separated list of what security issues to detect. Possible values are `vuln`, `config` and `secret`. Defaults to `vuln`.
  security_check: vuln
  #
  # insecure The flag to skip verifying registry certificate
  insecure: false
  # github_token The GitHub access token to download Trivy DB
  #
  # Anonymous downloads from GitHub are subject to the limit of 60 requests per hour. Normally such rate limit is enough
  # for production operations. If, for any reason, it's not enough, you could increase the rate limit to 5000
  # requests per hour by specifying the GitHub access token. For more details on GitHub rate limiting please consult
  # https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting
  #
  # You can create a GitHub token by following the instructions in
  # https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line
